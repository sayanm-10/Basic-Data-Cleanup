# Basic-Data-Cleanup
Given a CSV file, pre-process and clean the data. 


#### Load the CSV into R and perform the EDA analysis by:

1. Summarizing each column (e.g. min, max, mean )
2. Identifying missing values
3. Replacing the missing values with the “mode” (most frequent value) of the column.
4. Displaying the frequency table of “Class” vs. F6
5. Displaying the scatter plot of F1 to F6, one pair at a time
6. Show histogram box plot for columns F7 to F9

#### Delete all the objects from your R environment. Reload the CSV into R. Remove any row with a missing value in any of the columns.
